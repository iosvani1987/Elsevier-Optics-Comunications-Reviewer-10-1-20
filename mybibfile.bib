In contrast to the moire contouring technique, a grating pattern projected onto the object surface is Fourier-transformed and processed in its spatial frequency domain as well as in its space-signal domain. This technique has a much higher sensitivity than the conventional moire technique and is capable of fully automatic distinction between a depression and an elevation on the object surface. There is no requirement for assigning fringe orders and interpolating data in the regions between contour fringes. The technique is free from errors caused by spurious moire fringes generated by the higher harmonic components of the grating pattern.},

A population of chromosomes is codified with the parameters of the function that estimates the phase. A fitness function is established to evaluate the chromosomes, which considers: (a) the closeness between the observed fringes and the recovered fringes, (b) the phase smoothness, (c) the prior knowledge of the object as its shape and size.

The demodulation process proceeds row-by-row way passing from one sub-image in a neighborhood until the whole interferogram is processed. The modulating phase of each sub-image is modeled as a parametric analytic function whose parameters are optimized using a GA.

This leads to simple techniques for optimizing an interferogram for analysis by these Fourier transform methods and to an estimate of the error in the retrieved fringe shifts. This estimate is tested on simulated data and found to be reliable.},

However, it often fails in the cases of complex interferograms and needs well-defined scanning strategies. An improved algorithm based on the RPT is presented in this paper. We use a paraboloid phase model to approximate the phase function and modify the cost functional to search the smoothest phase solutions in the function space C2. With these modifications, the phase tracker preserves the robustness of the RPT while at the same time it is no more sensitive to stationary points and is capable of demodulating complex interferograms with arbitrary scanning schemes. Moreover, the phase reconstructed by the proposed algorithm is normally more accurate than that of the RPT both for noiseless and noisy interferograms under the same conditions. Computer simulations and experimental results are both presented.},

However, two disadvantages limit the applications of the RPT in practice. One is the necessity of a normalized fringe pattern as input and the other is the sensitivity to critical points. To overcome these two disadvantages, a generalized regularized phase tracker (GRPT) is presented. The GRPT is characterized by two novel improvements. First, a general local fringe model that includes a linear background, a linear modulation and a quadratic phase is adopted in the proposed enhanced cost function. Second, the number of iterations in the optimization process is proposed as a comprehensive measure of fringe quality and used to guide the demodulation path. With these two improvements, the GRPT can directly demodulate a single fringe pattern without any pre-processing and post-processing and successfully get rid of the problem of the sensitivity to critical points. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the GRPT.},

These filters are capable of adapting their tuning frequency to the local dominant spatial frequency of the input image while maintaining an arbitrarily narrow local frequency response; therefore they may be effectively used for the accurate recovery of the phase of broadband spatial-carrier fringe patterns, even when they are corrupted by a significant amount of noise. Also, by constraining the spatial variation of the adaptive frequency to be smooth, they permit the completely automatic recovery of local phase from single closed fringe pattern images, since the spurious discontinuities and sign reversals that one obtains from the classical Fourier-based methods are avoided in this case. Although the applications discussed here come from fringe pattern analysis in optics, these filters may also be useful in the solution of other problems, such as texture characterization and segmentation and the recovery of depth from stereoscopic pairs of images.},

In some areas of image analysis, this belief has restricted the application of the analytic signal concept to multiple dimensions. We show that, contrary to this view, there is a natural, isotropic, and elegant extension. We develop a novel two-dimensional transform in terms of two multiplicative operators: a spiral phase spectral (Fourier) operator and an orientational phase spatial operator. Combining the two operators results in a meaningful two-dimensional quadrature (or Hilbert) transform. The new transform is applied to the problem of closed fringe pattern demodulation in two dimensions, resulting in a direct solution. The new transform has connections with the Riesz transform of classical harmonic analysis. We consider these connections, as well as others such as the propagation of optical phase singularities and the reconstruction of geomagnetic fields.},

abstract = {Quadrature operators are useful for obtaining the modulating phase $\varphi$ in interferometry and temporal signals in electrical communications. In carrier-frequency interferometry and electrical communications, one uses the Hilbert transform to obtain the quadrature of the signal. In these cases the Hilbert transform gives the desired quadrature because the modulating phase is monotonically increasing. We propose an n-dimensional quadrature operator that transforms cos($\varphi$) into -sin($\varphi$) regardless of the frequency spectrum of the signal. With the quadrature of the phase-modulated signal, one can easily calculate the value of $\varphi$ over all the domain of interest. Our quadrature operator is composed of two n-dimensional vector fields: One is related to the gradient of the image normalized with respect to local frequency magnitude, and the other is related to the sign of the local frequency of the signal. The inner product of these two vector fields gives us the desired quadrature signal. This quadrature operator is derived in the image space by use of differential vector calculus and in the frequency domain by use of a n-dimensional generalization of the Hilbert transform. A robust numerical algorithm is given to find the modulating phase of two-dimensional single-image closed-fringe interferograms by use of the ideas put forward.},

abstract = {The method presented extracts the demodulated phase from only one fringe pattern. Locally, this method approaches the fringe pattern morphology with the help of a mathematical model. The degree of similarity between the mathematical model and the real fringe is estimated by minimizing a correlation function. To use an optimization process, we have chosen a polynomial form such as a mathematical model. However, the use of a polynomial form induces an identification procedure with the purpose of retrieving the demodulated phase. This method, polynomial modulated phase correlation, is tested on several examples. Its performance, in terms of speed and precision, is presented on very noised fringe patterns.},

abstract = {We present two robust algorithms for fringe pattern analysis with partial-field and closed fringes. The algorithm for partial-field fringe patterns is presented as a refinement method for precomputed coarse phases. Such an algorithm consists of the minimization of a regularized cost function that incorporates an outlier rejection strategy, which causes the algorithm to become robust. On the basis of the phase refinement method, we propose a propagative scheme for phase retrieval from closed-fringe interferograms. The algorithm performance is demonstrated by demodulating closed-fringe interferograms with complex spatial distribution of stationary points and gradients in the illumination components.},

abstract = {We propose a new approach to demodulate a single fringe pattern with closed fringes by using Local Adaptable Quadrature Filters (LAQF). Quadrature filters have been widely used to demodulate complete image interferograms with carrier frequency. However, in this paper, we propose the use of quadrature filters locally, assuming that the phase is locally quasimonochromatic, since quadrature filters are not capable to demodulate image interferograms with closed fringes. The idea, in this paper, is to demodulate the fringe pattern with closed fringes sequentially, using a fringe following scanning strategy. In particular we use linear robust quadrature filters to obtain a fast and robust demodulation method for single fringe pattern images with closed fringes. The proposed LAQF method does not require a previous fringe pattern normalization. Some tests with experimental interferograms are shown to see the performance of the method along with comparisons to its closest competitor, which is the Regularized Phase Tracker (RPT), and we will see that this method is tolerant to higher levels of noise.},

The phase with an undetermined sign is directly obtained by taking the arccosine value of a preprocessed fringe pattern. The local frequencies, also with an undetermined sign, are then estimated by local matching. The sign ambiguity is then removed simply by forcing the continuity of the local frequencies. The priority of sign determination is guided by the value of total local frequency (fringe density) so that the critical points are processed last. The proposed approach is verified by successful demodulation of a simulated fringe pattern and two experimental fringe patterns.},

Our algorithm constructs an unwrapped phase from previously computed phases with a simple open-fringe-analysis algorithm, twice applied for analyzing horizontal and vertical oriented fringes, respectively. That reduces the closed-fringe-analysis problem to that of choosing the better phase between the two oriented computed phases and then of estimating the local sign. By propagating the phase sign \[and a tilewise constant (DC) term\] by regions \[here named tiles\] instead of a pixelwise phase propagation, our analysis of closed-fringe patterns becomes more robust and faster. Additionally, we propose a multigrid refinement for improving the final computed phase.},

abstract = {A hybrid algorithm is proposed in this study for demodulating a single spatial carrier fringe pattern (FP) of interferometric measurement, which essentially combines the spatial carrier phase shift (SCPS) method and Fourier transform (FT) method. It firstly extracts three phase-shifted FPs from a single spatial carrier FP, then employs the FT method and a subtraction operation to determine the phase shift of three phase-shifted FPs, and finally retrieves the phase map using a least-square phase shift algorithm. The subtraction operation could considerably mitigate the inherent edge error of the FT method, resulting in an increase of accuracy compared with the FT method. It also does not require the background and modulation amplitude of the spatial carrier FP to be constant; thus it is robust and quite suitable for engineering. The factors that may influence the performance of the proposed algorithm are analyzed, including the random and speckle noise, carrier frequency, shape of the background, and modulation amplitude. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is validated by two experiments, comparing them with the temporal phase-shifted method. The proposed algorithm is expected to be used in interferometric measurement under adverse environments.},

abstract = {We propose a simple and robust polynomial-based phase-fitting (PPF) technique for single interferogram demodulation. Based on the smoothness assumption, the method employs a set of Zernike polynomials (ZPs) to fit the phase and estimates the expansion coefficients using a global optimization algorithm, i.e., differential evolution. The fitting order of the ZPs and the bounds of the coefficients can be intuitively determined according to the shape and number of fringes of the interferogram. Different from classical methods that need predefined scanning paths to guide the phase estimator, the PPF demodulates an interferogram globally and is insensitive to local defects, which allows it to deal with very noisy interferograms. Moreover, as the PPF gives the reconstructed phase by use of the ZPs, no further phase-unwrapping or wavefront-fitting procedures are needed. Experimental results have demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of the method.},

abstract = {A regularized phase tracker (RPT) is an effective method for demodulation of single closed-fringe patterns. However, lengthy calculation time, specially designed scanning strategy, and sign-ambiguity problems caused by noise and saddle points reduce its effectiveness, especially for demodulating large and complex fringe patterns. In this paper, a simplified paraboloid phase model-based regularized phase tracker (SPRPT) is proposed. In SPRPT, first and second phase derivatives are pre-determined by the density-direction-combined method and discrete higher-order demodulation algorithm, respectively. Hence, cost function is effectively simplified to reduce the computation time significantly. Moreover, pre-determined phase derivatives improve the robustness of the demodulation of closed, complex fringe patterns. Thus, no specifically designed scanning strategy is needed; nevertheless, it is robust against the sign-ambiguity problem. The paraboloid phase model also assures better accuracy and robustness against noise. Both the simulated and experimental fringe patterns (obtained using electronic speckle pattern interferometry) are used to validate the proposed method, and a comparison of the proposed method with existing RPT methods is carried out. The simulation results show that the proposed method has achieved the highest accuracy with less computational time. The experimental result proves the robustness and the accuracy of the proposed method for demodulation of noisy fringe patterns and its feasibility for static and dynamic applications.},
